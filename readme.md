# Local Beats

## Description
Local Beats will gather two suggestions from you, the type of music that you like or are interested in, and the city that you want to acquire. Local Beats will then use 2 APIs to give you suggestions. The first one is Youtube API. This API will give you a list of suggested music videos from the type of music you asked about from that city. The Other API is TicketMaster. This API will show you a list of events in the city that you chose.
## Purpose
Local Beats is an application that makes it simple and easy to find the music that you like and also provides events that will be in your area.
